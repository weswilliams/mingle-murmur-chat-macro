murmur_chat macro for mingle
* updates via ajax request every 10 seconds,
* using since as part of the request to reduce traffic

If you have an environment where you cannot have a chat service or install the murmur.air
chat tool from thoughtworks this could work for you. It is a simple macro that you can
put on a wiki page that updates similar to the murmur.air chat tool. Just keep a browser
window open with the wiki containing the macro and you have your chat tool.  They would
have to ban your planning tool to ban this chat. :)
